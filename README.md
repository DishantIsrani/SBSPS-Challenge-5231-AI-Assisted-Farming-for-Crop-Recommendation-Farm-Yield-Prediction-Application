# SBSPS-Challenge-5231-AI-Assisted-Farming-for-Crop-Recommendation-Farm-Yield-Prediction-Application

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Digital Farming and Precision Agriculture allow precise utilization of inputs like seed, water, pesticides, and fertilizers at the right time to the crop for maximizing productivity, quality and yields. Most of the farmers practice traditional farming patterns to decide crops to be cultivated in a field. Thus, the solution to this Challenge can be a crop recommendation system that helps farmers to decide the right crop to sow in their field and forecast the yield & revenue.
